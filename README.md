 # INSTALLATION #
 
 Pretty simple installation.. You just move these files in the Modpack to the dev_hdd0/GAMES/BLUS30888 where the original ones are.
 
 # KNOWN ISSUES #
 
 ~ Currently unable to load custom MESHES, TEXTURES, SOUNDS, etc. Working on it... BSA Loading theory is possible. Generally speaking it should be possible to load custom stuff, just not sure how yet... I'll get it though. 
 ~ More Perks have missing MESHES and TEXTURES - Acceptable for now.
 
 # GOALS #
 
- [ ] Figure out how to load custom MESHES, TEXTURES, SOUNDS, and other custom assets outside of standard file loading
- [ ] Complete Basic Package of functional mods
- [ ] Copy Fallout3 EliteElectronics .ini setup for testing
- [ ] Test all mods upon completion of Basic Package
