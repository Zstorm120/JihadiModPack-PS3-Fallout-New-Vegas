 # INSTALLATION #
 
 Pretty simple installation.. You just move these files in the Modpack to the dev_hdd0/GAMES/BLUS30888 where the original ones are.
 
 # KNOWN ISSUES #
 
 ~ Currently unable to load custom MESHES, TEXTURES, and SOUNDS; Not sure how to do it. More testing is required.  
 ~ More Perks / More Traits / etc do not have working Textures  
 ~ Sometimes the game can hardfreeze/lockup and requires manually powering the system down, not sure if this is just a now and then issue, or an issue caused by testing of the various mods.
 
 # GOALS #
 
- [ ] Figure out how to load custom MESHES, TEXTURES, SOUNDS, and other custom assets outside of standard file loading
- [ ] Complete Basic Package of functional mods
- [ ] Copy Fallout3 EliteElectronics .ini setup for testing
- [ ] Test all mods upon completion of Basic Package
